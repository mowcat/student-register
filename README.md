# student-register
A simple register-like program to track students in a class.
One of the problems is that it is not completely finished, so the features i plan to add (look in tasks) are not yet implemented.
Also, it is not curently available to install. You can download the code, sure, and run from an IDE like Eclipse, but there is no "installation" process involved.
